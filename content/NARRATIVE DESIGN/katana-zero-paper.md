*Katana ZERO* is a neo-noir action platformer by Askiisoft, published by Devolver Digital in 2019. My Game Narrative Review analyzes how its fragmented structure, shifting perspectives, and psychological motifs construct a fractured but empathetic antihero story. 

Submitted to the 2024 International Game Narrative Review (GNR) competition, this paper was awarded Platinum for excellence in narrative analysis .
