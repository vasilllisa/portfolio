*Little Nightmares II* is a puzzle-platformer horror game by Tarsier Studios, released in 2021. My Game Narrative Review explores how the game transforms childhood fears into hostile environments and grotesque antagonists, each embodying phobias and anxieties. By analyzing Mono and Sixâ€™s journey through schools, hospitals, and the Pale City, I show how level design and atmosphere externalize psychological tension. 

Submitted to the 2023 International Game Narrative Review (GNR), this paper was awarded Gold for excellence in narrative analysis.
