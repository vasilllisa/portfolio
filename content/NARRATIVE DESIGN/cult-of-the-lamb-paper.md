*Cult of the Lamb* is a roguelike action-adventure and cult management game by Massive Monster, released in 2022. My Game Narrative Review analyzes how its playful aesthetic contrasts with grotesque rituals to explore compliance, corruption, and the psychology of leadership. By examining the Lamb, its followers, and the gameâ€™s dual structure of combat and cult-building, I show how narrative and systems design intertwine to immerse players in questions of authority and devotion.
