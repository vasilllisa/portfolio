## **Overview**

I designed and built a five-level Portal 2 puzzle series focused on movement, timing, and momentum. The project explored how spatial flow and kinetic challenges could heighten player engagement beyond the game’s usual methodical pace. Each chamber escalated in complexity, layering mechanics to create a progression that felt fair while maintaining pressure. I tested the levels with players -- my unofficial test subjects -- listened to their feedback, and made changes to improve the *"aha!"* moments.

## **Design Philosophy**

*What if Portal 2’s puzzles didn’t just challenge your mind but also your reflexes?*

While the original game excels at clever, methodical problem-solving, I often found it too static and wanted to explore a more dynamic approach. I challenged myself to design puzzles that focused on momentum, vertical traversal, and timing without relying on gel mechanics like speed and jump boosts. I also wanted my levels to reward fast, energetic problem-solving, while staying true to the game’s tone.

To guide players, I emphasized visual clarity: sightline alignment, highlighted surfaces, and layouts that suggested flow without spelling out solutions. Playtests exposed sticking points, and I iterated on mechanics, timing windows, and spatial layouts until puzzles were challenging but fair.

## **Level 1: Timing and Precision**

*~1-2 minutes; 2 steps*

I designed Level 1 to teach players the project’s core vocabulary: *precision*, *timing*, and *pressure*. A tractor beam and timed flip panel require coordination of movement with mechanics, while the wall button establishes the cause-and-effect logic that threads through later chambers. The timed exit was deliberate, serving as the first step away from Portal 2’s static puzzle pacing and introducing a manageable layer of urgency before complexity increases. The simplicity makes it approachable, but it primes players for the more kinetic challenges ahead.

## **Level 2: Multi-Step Solutions**

*~2-6 minutes; 2 harder steps*

Level 2 was designed to deepen the puzzle language introduced in Level 1 by layering multiple mechanics into a single sequence. The polarized tractor beam and ground button create the first challenge, but the real focus is on using the tractor beam creatively to bypass fizzlers and deliver a cube to its target.

Playtesting exposed frustration when cubes slipped from a key button, forcing full restarts. To resolve this, I added a portalable surface above the button so players could quickly reposition cubes with the tractor beam. This adjustment preserved the challenge while removing unnecessary repetition.

The level shifts the experience from simple cause-and-effect into flexible problem solving, introducing toggled mechanics and fizzler navigation that prepare players for more dynamic movement puzzles later in the series.

## **Level 3: Momentum and Fizzlers**

*~5-10 minutes; 3 steps*

Level 3 was designed to shift the focus from static problem solving into movement-driven play. Momentum becomes the centerpiece, requiring players to chain timing, precision, and traversal into a single flow. Fizzlers gate progress, forcing careful synchronization, while momentum jumps demand players master vertical falls that convert into horizontal speed to reach new areas.

To tie progression together, I combined earlier mechanics: fizzler timing from Level 2 and the tractor beam and wall button logic from Level 1. The new element was momentum-based traversal, which asked players to “surf” through puzzles with fluidity rather than methodical pacing.

Playtesting guided refinements to fizzler timers and portal sightlines. By adjusting timing windows and adding visual cues, I ensured the challenge rewarded dexterity and quick thinking without feeling opaque.

## **Level 3: Momentum and Fizzlers**

*~5-10 minutes; 6 steps*

Level 4 was built to push vertical traversal into the spotlight. A spiral of six platforms demands momentum control through faith plates and jumps, while timed fizzlers introduce precision under pressure. The spatial design asks players to think in layers, climbing upward through a sequence that feels both physical and escalating.

The level connects back to earlier lessons: it borrows the multi-room structure of Level 3, expands on the cube-drop concept from Level 2 by forcing players to manipulate a cube midair with tractor beams and portals, and concludes with a familiar tractor beam and wall button puzzle first introduced in Level 1. This looping back reinforced continuity in the progression.

Playtesting revealed the original order of Levels 3 and 4 felt off, so I swapped them to create a smoother difficulty curve. I also refined platform spacing for cleaner momentum jumps and repositioned buttons to improve sightlines for fizzlers, walls, and jump paths. These changes made vertical movement demanding but intuitive.

## **Level 5: The Final Boss**

*~5-16 minutes; 4 harder steps*

Level 5 was designed as the culmination of the entire series, weaving together every mechanic players had learned. The cube spawner became the centerpiece, requiring players to use momentum to launch cubes into a tractor beam without ever touching them. A vertical moving platform paired with a flip panel added layered timing, forcing players to manage both spatial awareness and rhythm under pressure.

The level deliberately echoed the series’ progression: momentum jumps from Levels 3 and 4 returned with tighter timing, the polarized tractor beam from Level 2 reappeared with new fizzler navigation challenges, and the final puzzle closed on the tractor beam and wall button structure first introduced in Level 1. This recursive structure created a sense of closure while testing mastery.

Playtests revealed the moving platform and flip panel sequence was never solved on the first attempt, but adding more panels only cluttered the layout. Instead, I iterated on portalable tile placement until the solution felt discoverable without losing tension. Once understood, players consistently described the cube-momentum mechanic as the most exciting payoff of the series.
