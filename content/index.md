# Welcome
## about me
Hey there! My name is Vasilisa, I’m a game designer focused on UI/UX and Level Design. 

I design so that things feel clear, comfortable, and natural, without needing extra explanation. I’m good at finding structure in messy systems and making things work quietly, without drawing attention to the effort behind them. Detail-oriented, calm under pressure, quick to understand, I think through doing, not theorizing. What matters most to me is that the player feels grounded and understood.

This website is made using obsidian with quartz as a publisher. Obsidian is a very tag-based app,  many people use it to create their *digital gardens* or *zettlekastens* but I made it my portfolio website.
