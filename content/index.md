## **Welcome**

<span id="greeting">Good day!</span> You are here, by intent or by chance, and this site is a record of how I work.

## **About Me**

My name is Vasilisa, a game designer focused on #level-design and #uiux-design, with occasional forays into #narrative-design.

I design with conviction, guided by a strong internal sense of what feels right, though I sometimes stop to question whether that sense holds. For me design is never neutral but always a choice, and I have little patience for gestures that add nothing or for solutions that collapse once put to use. That instinct gives my work its shape, because every judgment rests on whether the design communicates clearly, and each project becomes a process of layering and refining, adding and adjusting until the whole carries the weight and coherence I am after.

In **level design** I begin with the concrete, a moment or element that feels alive to me, and from there I build outward, letting the space grow until it feels realistic, weighted, and continuous. In **UI** and **visual design** I move with immediacy, the tools become extensions of my hands, I can sketch and prototype quickly, and the results often read as finished because my attention naturally organizes the screen. Even so, I return to details repeatedly, polishing and replacing them when I find a version that carries the idea more cleanly, until fragments resolve into structures that hold together.

What ties it all is the interplay of intuition and discipline, the constant back-and-forth between a private standard of what feels right and the polish that makes it visible. I stay with difficult problems until they yield, not from any love of struggle but because I cannot let work remain rough, and I often lose myself in the smallest details, adjusting and re-adjusting until the surface is as clean as I can make it. When the design locks into place, it carries that signature: *direct*, *detailed*, and *clear*.

I am also a massive [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) shill, so if you like the design of this site you should definitely check them out, along with [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz). Think of this site as a spiderweb, its strands connected by tags into a singular graph of my work.
