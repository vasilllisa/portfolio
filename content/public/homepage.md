about me~
I’m a game designer focused on UI/UX and Level Design. I graduated from DigiPen in 2025 with a degree in Game Design and a minor in Art. I design so that things feel clear, comfortable, and natural, without needing extra explanation. I’m good at finding structure in messy systems and making things work quietly, without drawing attention to the effort behind them. Detail-oriented, calm under pressure, quick to understand, I think through doing, not theorizing. What matters most to me is that the player feels grounded and understood.
