### I researched and identified the user experience problem of the _Minecraft’s inventory system__._

#### BEFORE and after figma prototype:


## Why?
**Picture this:** I'm minding my own business, sipping on my tea, and all I hear from my little eight year old sister in the next room is a symphony of grunts and whines. Turns out, she's not battling creepers—she's grappling with the chaotic mess that is Minecraft's inventory system on her iPad. Being the _amazing_ sibling that I am, I decided to dive into this issue and figure out a way to make life easier for iPad kids like her. (Plus, fewer whines mean a more peaceful coexistence.)

### Other Motivations
#### Parental Peace of Mind
Offering parents peace of mind by creating a user-friendly inventory system, ensuring kids engage in the game responsibly and without constant tech-related headaches.

#### Educational Integration
Enhancing item recognition and organization can provide educational benefits, helping younger players learn and understand different items within the game.

#### Boosting creativity
Unleashing the creative potential of young minds by simplifying the inventory, allowing players to focus more on building and designing within the game.


## Approach
### Techniques
#### User-Centered Design
**Prioritized clarity and simplicity in the interface, ensuring students easily manage classes and access information for a satisfying scheduling experience.**

#### Iterative Design
**Conducted user research, created wireframes, and iterated designs based on feedback. This iterative process ensures that the solutions are aligned with user needs.**


## Research

I visited my sister's school, seeking permission from parents to interview their children. As an incentive, I offered Minecraft figurines to the participants. I conducted the interviews, took notes, and utilized Google Forms for streamlined data organization. To conclude, I invited participants to sketch their recollection of the Minecraft inventory.

### Key Findings
#### **Participants**
- **The survey included responses from 12 participants, all between the ages of 7 and 11.**
- **Experience levels ranged from 1 to 7 years, with the majority having 2-5 years of experience.**

#### **_demographics:_**

Based on the research findings, I crafted a persona, Max, who embodies the characteristics, behaviors, and preferences of the target user group, representing the typical young IPad Minecraft player.

**_NAME_:** **Max // Minecraft Adventure Enthusiast****_AGE_:** **8****_RELATIONSHIP STATUS_:** **Single****_CAREER_:** **Elementary school student**

#### **_backstory:_**

**_Max is an excited 8-year-old who loves exploring and building in Minecraft. He recently got into the game and enjoys creating amazing structures and landscapes to show his family and friends. When he's not playing, Mason is busy with school and likes sharing his Minecraft stories with friends._**

#### **_Motivations:_**

- **Building exciting and creative structures in Minecraft.**
    
- **Exploring new terrains and discovering hidden treasures.**
    
- **Connecting with friends and sharing gaming experiences.**
    

#### **_ideal experience:_**

#### **_frustrations:_**

- **Running out of inventory space while exploring and collecting materials.**
    
- **Difficulty in finding specific items quickly within the cluttered inventory.**
    
- **Managing numerous items and juggling between different items during gameplay**
    

**Max eagerly logs into Minecraft, excited to continue his adventures Minecraft. He imagines an inventory system where he can seamlessly organize his tools, materials, and treasures based on his adventurous pursuits. The system should allow him to categorize items, stack important resources, and easily access what he needs. Max envisions a user-friendly interface that saves him time, reduces frustration, and maximizes his enjoyment as he delves deeper into the realms of Minecraft.**

## problem statement

To address the identified pain points, which revealed challenges in item management, inventory overload, and item recognition, I created a problem statement.

#### The formula:

[Create/Modify/Define] a [**noun**] in order for a [**specific user type**] to [**feel a certain way / accomplish a certain thing**].

Create an **adjustable inventory management system on the IPad** for **young(er) Minecraft players**, empowering them to seamlessly organize and access in-game items, fostering **a sense of control and mastery,** while simultaneously expanding their **vocabulary and knowledge** related to in-game items.

### Sketching phase

I translated initial design concepts from mental notes. The first design captured the essence of my vision effectively. I also used the users’ sketches as reference. After a comparative analysis of inventory layouts across various platforms, it became apparent that aligning the iPad version with other platforms would enhance user familiarity.

### figma remake

To streamline the design process and understand the navigation system, I recreated and prototyped the original layout of Minecraft on IPad in Figma. This served as a foundation for implementing changes seamlessly, allowing for a side-by-side comparison with the redesigned elements.

## User testing results

I reached out to five participants who had previously completed the initial survey.

### What Users Liked:

1. Users appreciated the new search and loadout features for their effectiveness, especially in high-pressure situations.  

2. Participants noted that the new design was visually appealing.

### Needs to be fixed:

1. Users prefer an option to hide item descriptions, as not all of them are interested in this information.
    
2. Participants pointed out that the search keyboard can obstruct search results.
    
3. Participants were uncertain about the meaning of red squares as no “uncraftable items” were shown.
    
4. When presented with numerous grid squares in search results (in the recipe book), users felt overwhelmed.
    
5. Users found it challenging to tap on small icons when creating loadouts.
    
6. Users still struggled to gauge inventory space, even with numbers in the hotbar and loadout, due to visibility issues.
    
7. Users expressed a desire to see how they could customize new sections at the top and noted they wouldn't have noticed the "add your own section" feature without guidance.


## key learnings
### Surprises that shaped Design Direction

I initially expected anticipated reluctance or disinterest from kids and parents regarding participation.

In reality I got a positive response with enthusiasm and curiosity, with some expressing aspirations to become game designers. This unexpected positivity fueled motivation and added a human touch to the project.


I assumed that initial design ideas would resonate with users without significant adjustments.

Received valuable feedback during user testing that led to fundamental design changes, particularly in the need to provide an option to hide item descriptions. This emphasized the importance of ongoing user feedback and its role in refining the design direction.


### obstacles faced
- Engaging children in meaningful discussions for making design decisions proved to be challenging. Formulating simple yet impactful questions that captured their attention and facilitated constructive feedback was hard.  
  But, in conclusion, this experience emphasized the importance of adapting communication strategies for different user groups.

- I faced challenges in resisting the temptation to add features that did not align with core user needs.
  But I instituted a strict prioritization framework based on user feedback and project goals. This helped in keeping the design focused on addressing key pain points and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

- Approaching parents for permission initially proved challenging due to a personal discomfort with seeking help.
  However, I overcame this obstacle by emphasizing the educational benefits of the project and expressing genuine interest in the participants' insights. This experience served as a valuable lesson in stepping out of comfort zones for project success.
