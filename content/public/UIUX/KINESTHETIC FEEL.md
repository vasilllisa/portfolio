**LAKE LEOTA** dives into kinesthetic game design, focusing on how **controls**, **camera movement**, **audio**, and **visuals** combine to create an immersive and intense experience.  
  
Below, you'll find two versions of the video presentation:  
1. Video with commentary, where I walk you through how these design elements effectively contribute to the game's atmosphere  
2. Video without commentary, allowing you to directly experience the game's environment.



**KINESTHETIC FEEL** is the integration of controls, camera, audio, and visuals in game design that creates a tactile and immersive experience, physically and mentally connecting players to the game world.

#### Freezing | Suffocating | Haunting

— these three adjectives guided the design and emotional depth of this project.

While brainstorming **LAKE LEOTA**, I looked to games like **Subnautica**, **ABZÛ**, and **Iron Lung** for inspiration, each known for their deep, immersive environments.  
This helped shape the project's direction.  
  
I also used a design method called the SUD list—Signal, Update, Resolution—to ensure each gameplay element was well-planned.
