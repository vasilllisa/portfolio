## Why?

**_Picture this:_** **A college freshman****, halfway across the globe,** **battling a monstrous scheduling process** **with a sluggish laptop and a ticking clock. The late-night struggle culminated in a hard-fought victory against the scheduling chaos, but** **at the cost of sleep and sanity****.**

**It's a story familiar to many students****, including myself.**

**Motivated by this personal experience****, I embarked on the mission to streamline the academic scheduling process, aiming to prevent others from enduring such hardships (and perhaps upgrading to a bigger laptop along the way :D ).**

## Core school values

## approach

### Techniques

#### _User-Centered Design_

**Prioritized clarity and simplicity in the interface, ensuring students easily manage classes and access information for a satisfying scheduling experience.**

#### _heuristic evaluation_

**Applied Jakob Nielsen's usability heuristics to evaluate the existing design. Identified areas for improvement based on these established usability guidelines.**

#### _Iterative Design_

**Conducted user research, created wireframes, and iterated designs based on feedback. This iterative process ensures that the solutions are aligned with user needs.**

#### _competitive audit_

**Conducted a competitive audit by analyzing interfaces and online tools of other platforms offering class scheduling features.**



## research

I conducted user research to uncover challenges within DigiPen's Student Planning system. Users expressed a desire for improvements in simplicity, clarity, and responsiveness, providing valuable input to identify key pain points.

#### **participants**

**In a series of 9 user interviews, participants represented a range of degree programs.  
Among them:**

- **3 were enrolled in Computer Science (CS)**
- **3 in Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA)**
- **3 in Bachelor of Arts in Game Design (BAGD)**

**This diversity in programs provides valuable insights into user perspectives.**



#### **External Methods**

#### **Digital Tools**
- **MyStudyLife App**
- **Google Calendar**
**Users noted the advantages of these tools such as** **mobile notifications and ease of access.**

#### **Simplified approach**
- **Physical Planners**
- **Personal Word Documents**
**This choice highlighted a preference for manageable and uncomplicated solutions for organizing.**




### suggestions

#### simplicity

Make it easier to manage classes within the timeline and provide more detailed class information.

This includes adding a sidebar that displays class details, such as degree requirements and prerequisites, and simplifying the process of adding, dropping, or changing classes directly within the timeline.

->
#### challenging class searching

Freshman students face difficulties in finding and moving classes efficiently. The current interface lacks a user-friendly search feature, making it hard to locate and add desired courses. This challenge leads to frustration and wasted time in the scheduling process.

---
#### clarity

Improve the clarity and overview of in-progress items within the Student Planning section. Some users expressed a desire for better organization and visibility of their ongoing academic progress and tasks.

->
#### Inconvenient navigation
The existing interface lacks navigational convenience. Students find it challenging to move between different sections and pages, resulting in a disjointed user experience. This lack of convenience requires extra effort and time for basic scheduling tasks, causing frustration.

---
#### responsiveness
Address the clunky or less responsive nature of the Student Planning section's interface. Users mentioned that while there isn't a specific major flaw, they feel that the tool could be made more responsive and user-friendly, potentially enhancing the overall user experience.

->
#### limited access to information
Freshman students struggle to access crucial information about their classes. The current interface does not provide an easy way to access comprehensive details about courses, including prerequisites, availability, and completion status. This limited access to essential class information hampers effective academic planning and contributes to an unsatisfactory user experience.



## target user

I analyzed the data collected from the research to identify recurring themes and patterns. This included pinpointing common frustrations, understanding what motivated the users, and discerning the specific challenges faced by students

### Freshman DigiPen students who are learning the school’s websites and online services, while simultaneously acclimating to college life and managing a variety of academic responsibilities and external commitments.
