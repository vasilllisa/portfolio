## **Overview**

**LAKE LEOTA** is a Unity prototype built to test how kinesthetic feel can carry a fearful descent into deep water.

**KINESTHETIC FEEL** here means the integration of input response, camera motion, soundscape, and visual feedback so players connect physically and mentally to the game world, interpreting fear through their hands, screen, and gut.

The goal was to create a short first person slice where thalassophobia is felt directly through play rather than explained through description. I achieved this through shivering dock cameras, underwater input resistance, heartbeat timed vibrations, muffled audio transitions, and silhouettes surfacing from darkness.

## **Design Process**

Players rarely notice how much invisible work goes into making a game feel right. Every vibration, every camera sway, every audio cue is part of UX design at a sensory level. I’ve always been sensitive to those small details, and after working on _Lake Leota_ I catch myself dissecting how other games achieve their atmosphere, noticing the tiny choices that make an experience *immersive* or *hollow*. It made me realize how much I care about the kinesthetic layer of play, the part that connects intention in the player’s head to sensation in their body.

That curiosity pushed me to see if I could recreate an experience that had haunted me in real life. A few months before the project, I jumped into a lake with friends in the beginning of February. I’m a strong swimmer, but the second I lose sight or feel of the ground, fear takes over. Standing on the dock that night, I was genuinely terrified. My heart sank, my imagination filled in the darkness below, and when I finally jumped, those few seconds underwater felt endless. That moment became the foundation for _Lake Leota_.

### Goals

#### **FREEZING | SUFFOCATING | HAUNTING** 
-- *These adjectives framed the emotional core of the project.*

From the start, I wanted players to feel not just that they were looking at a lake, but that they were **inside its suffocating space**. _FREEZING_ defined the cold shock of the plunge, _SUFFOCATING_ shaped sluggish movement and muffled audio, and _HAUNTING_ came from the fear of the unknown, with silhouettes and sonar pulses suggesting vast, unseen creatures in the dark.

### Research

To ground the project, I studied other games that capture underwater immersion. _Subnautica_ showed me how to stage fear of the unknown through scale and sound. _ABZÛ_ demonstrated how lighting and animations could amplify the sense of discovery and vulnerability. _Iron Lung_ pushed me to embrace restriction, using minimal visuals and heavy atmosphere to let the player’s imagination do the work. Each reference gave me a tool for how to stage my own descent into darkness.

### Planning

I broke the design down into four directions—controls, camera, audio, visuals—and used a SUR list (Signal, Update, Resolution) to plan specific beats for each. For controls I sketched ideas like delayed underwater input and heartbeat-timed vibration. For camera, I mapped out vertigo zooms and underwater drift. For audio, I listed transitions from party noise to muffled breath and silence. For visuals, I staged contrasts of light and darkness, with silhouettes appearing only briefly.

### Implementation

That planning became a checklist of kinesthetic elements I wanted to build. From there, it was about layering each piece into Unity until the experience felt closer to my memory of that winter jump.

With the first version complete, the next step was to put it in front of players. Playtesting became the measure of whether those details actually translated into the sensations I was chasing.

### Playtesting

Players consistently remarked on how the experience shifted as they progressed. The breathing that began loud and heavy eventually faded to near silence, which several described as unsettling. Lighting drew similar comments: the transition from faint dock light to near-total darkness underwater was noted as a strong atmospheric turn. Controls and camera were described as responsive at first and then noticeably sluggish, a change that players often linked to the feeling of sinking.

The psychological impact was harder to miss. By the end, most players had stopped talking and simply played in silence, absorbed in the final stretch. One described the arc as having a “clear beginning, middle, and end,” which reinforced that the pacing felt intentional. There was also feedback about how much exposure weakens tension. Fear doesn’t come from what is shown but from what might be there. Too much exposure collapses the unknown into the *ordinary*. The shark encounter was a clear example.

## **Ending Note**

What stayed with me most was the silence at the end, when the sonar pulse slipped into a flatline and nothing followed. That moment convinced me that kinesthetic design is built out of details players rarely notice on their own, yet those details stack up into the memories they carry with them.

I still avoid swimming where I cannot see the bottom. Turns out I’d rather fake it in Unity than find out what is actually waiting down there.
