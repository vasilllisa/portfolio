## **Overview**

This project reimagines the **Minecraft inventory system on iPad**, with a focus on younger players who often struggle with cluttered layouts and confusing item management. Over the course of one month, I researched how kids interact with the game, identified pain points in the existing system, and prototyped a redesign that makes inventory more intuitive and accessible without losing the depth of the original game.

I worked **solo** as the UI/UX designer, covering the full pipeline: user interviews, persona creation, wireframing, prototyping in Figma, and usability testing. The result is a streamlined inventory that supports faster item recognition, customizable categories, and adaptive layouts that keep gameplay smooth for new and experienced players alike.

## **Context**

Picture this: I’m sipping tea in the other room when my eight-year-old sister starts up a chorus of grunts and whines. At first I assume she’s under attack by mobs. Turns out, the real enemy was the iPad inventory screen.

Being the helpful sibling (and tired of the noise), I decided to take on the redesign myself. The aim was simple: make inventory management less chaotic for kids, so they can focus on building worlds instead of wrestling with menus.

Beyond just convenience, the redesign aimed to:
- Give parents peace of mind by making the interface easier for kids to navigate independently.
- Support learning by helping kids recognize and organize items more effectively.
- Boost creativity by letting players focus on building and exploring instead of digging through clutter.

## **Research**

### Methodology

To understand how kids actually interact with Minecraft’s inventory, I visited my sister’s school and got permission from parents to run short interviews. As an incentive, I handed out Minecraft figurines. Kids drew sketches of the inventory from memory, and I organized responses using Google Forms.

### Key Findings

- **Participants:** 12 kids, ages 7-11, with 1-7 years of play experience.
- **Item overload:** Most collected too many items and struggled to keep track.
- **Recognition issues:** 8 out of 12 couldn’t name items by appearance alone.
- **Organization habits:** 11 out of 12 admitted they never organize their inventory mid-game.
- **Navigation gaps:** Many forgot crafting, armor, or the hotbar were even part of the inventory.

### Target User

Based on the research, I created a persona to guide design choices. Max represents the typical young Minecraft player on iPad -- eager to explore and build, but often slowed down by the messy menus. This kept the redesign focused on the real challenges kids face in play.

![[mc_persona_max.jpg|300]]

```
Persona: Max  
Age: 8  
Role: Elementary school student, Minecraft Adventure Enthusiast  
Context: Plays Minecraft on iPad after school, shares creations with friends and family, limited reading ability, prefers visual cues over text.  

Goals:  
- Build exciting structures and explore new areas.
- Collect and use items quickly without breaking the flow of play.
- Show friends his creations and discoveries.

Frustrations:  
- Runs out of inventory space mid-adventure.
- Struggles to find specific items in cluttered menus.
- Forgets parts of the inventory (crafting, armor, hotbar) exist.

Environment & Tools:  
- iPad with touchscreen controls.
- Often plays in short sessions at home.
- Limited patience for long or complex menus.
  
```

### **Problem Statement**

Utilizing insights from the target user, Max, I focused on his main frustrations:
- cluttered menus
- difficulty finding items 
- parts of the inventory (crafting, armor, hotbar) were often forgotten

These mapped to three broader issues:
- item management
- inventory overload
- item recognition

To address them, I defined the problem statement as:
> Create an adjustable iPad inventory system for younger Minecraft players that makes organizing and finding items simple, intuitive, and fast so gameplay stays focused on adventure, not menus.

---
## **Design Process**

The pain points identified in research and summarized in the problem statement set the direction for design. Max’s frustrations with clutter, recognition, and forgotten features became the criteria for every decision that followed.

I began with quick sketches, combining my own layout ideas with drawings from participants. These showed how often kids overlooked the hotbar, armor, or crafting, underscoring the need for a clearer hierarchy.

To build a stronger foundation, I rebuilt the iPad inventory in Figma and compared it to versions on Xbox, Switch, and PC. This cross-platform analysis highlighted where consistency could help players switch devices smoothly, and where touch-specific changes were necessary.

</figure>

From this foundation, I moved into targeted redesigns that tackled Max’s pain points one by one. The following iterations show how the inventory was reworked into a system that is faster to navigate, easier to recognize, and flexible enough to support different play-styles.

### **Loadout Switcher**

Quick-access icons let players swap between loadouts like Fighting, Building, or Food directly from the HUD without digging through menus.

### **Expanded Inventory Layout**

The inventory takes cues from the classic PC version, showing more of the game world while keeping navigation clear and touch-friendly.

### **Search & Filters**

The redesigned inventory adds a search bar with filters for amount, alphabet, and time picked up, making it faster to locate items. Tagged searches such as `#equipment` highlight all related items at once.

Inside the recipe book, a category bar groups items into sections like Materials, Gear, Useful, and Misc. A plus button lets players create new tabs, so the menu can grow with their needs instead of staying fixed.

### **Custom Loadouts Menu**

A dedicated menu organizes hotbars into categories such as Default, Materials, or Consumables, with the option to create new ones.

### **Item Details & Tags**

Tapping an item opens a larger visual with crafting info and optional personal tags, helping players recognize and organize items on their own terms.

With these problems defined and addressed through iterative design, the next step was to test the prototypes with players and measure how well the solutions held up in practice.

---
## **Outcome**

Participants tested both the original iPad inventory and the redesigned prototype. Across the board, they preferred the new system, describing it as easier to navigate and more enjoyable to use. Several even asked when this version would be available in the game.

The critiques were just as valuable. Some icons were too small for quick taps, and the expandable recipe tabs weren’t always noticed right away. This feedback reminded me how easily overlooked details can impact usability, especially for younger players.

Overall, the redesign replaced frustration with a sense of control and clarity. While not flawless, it demonstrated that addressing a few targeted pain points could transform the inventory into a tool players welcomed rather than resisted.

## **Ending Note**

This project started with an assumption that kids might be reluctant to participate, or that my first design ideas would carry through without much pushback. The opposite happened. The kids were enthusiastic, curious, and even excited to imagine themselves as future game designers. Their energy kept me motivated and reminded me that testing with real users often reshapes ideas more than polished wireframes ever could.

The process wasn’t without challenges. Keeping the scope focused meant resisting the urge to add features that sounded interesting but didn’t solve the core problems. Even something as simple as asking parents for permission required me to step outside my comfort zone and explain why the project mattered. Those small hurdles turned out to be as instructive as the design work itself.

In the end, the redesign gave kids an inventory they enjoyed using, and gave me fewer complaints from the next room. Hard to say which outcome felt more rewarding, but I’ll count both as wins.
